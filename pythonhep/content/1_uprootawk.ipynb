    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-HEP is a community-driven project that provides a comprehensive software ecosystem for high energy physics (HEP) analysis in Python. Its goal is to standardize and streamline data analysis workflows in HEP by offering a coherent collection of libraries that integrate with widely used tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. Among its major packages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Uproot: For reading and writing ROOT files without requiring ROOT.\n",
    "  * Awkward Arrays: For the handling of jagged data structures.\n",
    "  * Hist: For creating and manipulating histograms.\n",
    "  * Vector: For manipulating and operating on vectors of different kinds in a high-performance manner.\n",
    "  * Boost-Histogram: For fast, multi-dimensional histogramming.\n",
    "  * Particle: For handling particle physics data, including properties and PDG codes.\n",
    "  * Iminuit: For fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the main components of the Scikit-HEP project, starting with Uproot and building from there. For more information on the Scikit-HEP project and the tools it offers, please visit the official [Scikit-HEP Project Website](https://scikit-hep.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROOT Files\n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT files are a specialized binary file format developed for the efficient storage and analysis of large-scale data in high energy physics (HEP). They are structured hierarchically, much like a miniature filesystem, allowing for the organization of data into nested directories and subdirectories. Within these directories, ROOT files can store a wide variety of data types, including TTrees (which are analogous to tables or dataframes and are optimized for fast access to large datasets), histograms, graphs, and even user-defined objects. This flexible structure makes ROOT files particularly well-suited for complex experimental data, where different types of information (e.g., event records, calibration constants, and analysis results) need to be stored together in a single, organized file.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example ROOT file structure can be seen in {numref}`roottree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ./assets/roottree.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "height: 350px\n",
    "name: roottree\n",
    "---\n",
    "ROOT file structure example.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look a bit more closely at what each part of this example ROOT file are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TDirectorys are container objects that act like a directory in a filesystem. I can hold other objects such as histograms, TTrees, or even other TDirectories.\n",
    "- TTrees are a high-performance data structure designed with storing large tabular datasets in ROOT files. It is conceptually similar to a table or a DataFrame, where each row (i.e., \"entry\" or \"event\") represents a single data record, and each column (i.e., \"branch\") holds a specific variable or array of variables.\n",
    "- TBranches corresponds to a column in a TTree. Each contains data for a specific variable or set of variables. They can store simple types (like numbers) or complex objects (like arrays or custom classes).\n",
    "- A TBasket is a chunck or block of data in a TBranch. They allow for more efficient access to parts of the data without having to load the entire branch into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uproot\n",
    "\n",
    "Uproot allows us to read and write ROOT files. It interacts with Numpy, Pandas as well as the packages offered by Scikit-HEP. It was created to not have to use ROOT in order to quickly work with ROOT files, which can be slow to load."
